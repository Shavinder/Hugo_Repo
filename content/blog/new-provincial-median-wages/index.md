Government of Canada has announced new provincial/territorial median wage rates, which decide whether an LMIA application falls under a High-wage position or Low-wage position.

If the wage rate being offered to a Temporary Foreign Worker is at or higher than the provincial/territorial median hourly wage rate, the LMIA application has to be made in High-wage position category. If the wage offered is lower, the application has to be made in Low-wage category.
