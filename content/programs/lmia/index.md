An LMIA is an assessment whether the employment of the foreign national is likely to have a neutral or positive effect on the labour market in Canada.

When conducting this assessment Service Canada officers take into account several factors such as:

- whether the employment of a foreign national is likely to result in direct job creation or job retention for Canadian citizens or permanent residents.
- whether the employment is likely to result in creation or transfer of skills and knowledge for the benefits of Canadian citizens or permanent residents.
- whether the employment is likely to fill a labour shortage.
- whether the wages offered to foreign nation are consistent with the prevailing wage rate for the occupation and whether the working conditions meet generally accepted Canadia standards.
- whether the employer will hire or train Canadian citizens of permanent residents or has made, or has agreed to make, reasonable efforts to do so.
- whether the employment of the foreign national is likely to adversely affect the settlement of any labour dispute
- whether the employer has fulfilled or made reasonable efforts to fulfill any commitments made in context of a previous LMIA assessment.
- whether a language other than English or French is required for the job and if so, is it a bona fide requirement.
