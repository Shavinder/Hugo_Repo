A candidate has to include themselves, their spouse or common-law partner, their dependent children, and their spouse's dependent children in the family. The spouse and dependent children are to be counted even if they are Canadian citizens or they are not coming to Canada with the applicant.

Funds need to be readily available for use. Equity in a real property cannot be used. A spouse's money can be counted if they are accompanying the candidate to Canada. The funds should be available at the time of application as well as the time of landing in Canada.
