Launched on January 1, 2015, the Express Entry is an online system for managing Permanent Residence applications from skilled workers. It cover applications under three categories:

- [Federal Skilled Worker class]({{<relref "federal-skilled-worker">}})
- [Federal Skilled Trades class]({{<relref "federal-skilled-trades">}})
- [Canadian Experience class]({{<relref "canadian-experience-class">}})

In order to apply under the Express Entry system, an applicant has to be eligible under at least one of the three classes.

## How it works

A candidate creates an online profile. If eligible under one of the three classes, the profile is added to a pool where it is given a rank using a ranking system known as Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) with a maximum score of 1200. Periodically, draws are taken from the pool and the profiles with highest scores are sent _Invitations to Apply (ITA)_ for permanent residency. A profile remains active for one year. If a profile is not selected in one year the applicant can can apply again. Upon receiving an invitation a candidate has 60 days to make their application for permanent residency. Most applications are processed within six months.
